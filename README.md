# Chess Game

This is a Chess game I coded a while back. It has support for all legal moves except for capturing en passant with a pawn and promoting a pawn (they automatically promote to queens). It also calculates checks and checkmates. Below are some screenshots showing the interface for making moves as well as 2 common openings, the Queen's Pawn Gambit and the Ruy Lopez. In coding this, I learned a lot about inheritance and class design, before I had taken any OOP programming courses (such as AP CSA). It uses an interface library (with support for buttons and menus) that I programmed from scratch. It uses SFML to draw the graphics.
